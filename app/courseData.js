    //     summary: 'Made popular by TV dramas such as C.S.I., forensic sciences have gained much attention in criminal investigation. However, fictional dramas spread many misconceptions about the real world of the forensic science. This course explores the use of scientific methods, specifically in forensic sciences, of collecting, experimenting and analysing the evidence of crime scene, to be used in the court of law in solving crime. Finally, it encourages students to critically examine the use and value of forensic sciences in the legal system and how it contributes to addressing crime in society.',

Discussions and readings that provide in-depth, analytical, and critical perspectives on urbanisation and urbanism in Asia will be supplemented with a field trip to Singapore City Gallery and workshops on Futures Thinking. In particular, students will be taught the Casual Layered Analysis (CLA) methodology to help them think critically and deeply about present trends and the multiplicity of future scenarios. Through Singapore as a case study, students will gain a deeper understanding of challenges facing a rapidly-urbanising Asia, cultivate intellectual tools to evaluate these challenges and embody solutions through a hands-on creative project.',
