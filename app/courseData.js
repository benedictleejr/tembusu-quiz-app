        summary: 'Made popular by TV dramas such as C.S.I., forensic sciences have gained much attention in criminal investigation. However, fictional dramas spread many misconceptions about the real world of the forensic science. This course explores the use of scientific methods, specifically in forensic sciences, of collecting, experimenting and analysing the evidence of crime scene, to be used in the court of law in solving crime. Finally, it encourages students to critically examine the use and value of forensic sciences in the legal system and how it contributes to addressing crime in society.',

The theme of the archaeology of the future considers the many layers of the city, from examining its past to identifying its already emerging possible urban futures. Discussions and readings that provide in-depth, analytical, and critical perspectives on urbanisation and urbanism in Asia will be supplemented with a field trip to Singapore City Gallery and workshops on Futures Thinking. In particular, students will be taught the Casual Layered Analysis (CLA) methodology to help them think critically and deeply about present trends and the multiplicity of future scenarios. Through Singapore as a case study, students will gain a deeper understanding of challenges facing a rapidly-urbanising Asia, cultivate intellectual tools to evaluate these challenges and embody solutions through a hands-on creative project.',

This seminar attempts to meditate on the idea of games to develop an appreciation of gaming in life — with an accent on gaming life. Games, including specific games, are explored in theoretical and practical ways to develop questions involving — interrelating — tekhnē, technologies, cultures, epistemologies, and human communities. Further explorations potentially lead us to gaming cultures, including strategies, tactics, entanglements, addictions, pleasures, desires, délices, jouissances — exploring them in domains such as ‘political’, ‘social’, ‘familial’, ‘academic’, games, amongst many others — with play and praxis being echoes resounding through this seminar. Seminarians will engage in the construction, critique, and creation of games —imagining, and bringing forth, concepts in relation to the worlds in which we live.',

To stimulate creative ideas for improving research design, students critically appraise modern and historical literature on ideal societies and human flourishing, and learn to apply theory to encourage positive behaviors through designed interventions.

The idea that smart minds are essential for survival has shaped domestic policies and international positioning strategies. We ask: in what ways has human intelligence been defined, measured and harnessed? What counts as intelligence, and what does not? Beyond notions of intelligence centred on the human individual, we will also consider forms of collective and artificial intelligence, mediated by science and technology. What kinds of intelligence are needed for the future and how can Singapore develop them?',

The rapid advancement in science and technology adds to the challenge of interpreting highly technical, domain‐specific information, which is critical in rationalizing decisions and persuading counterparts.
